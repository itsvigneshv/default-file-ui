# Design File UI

Build and critique frontend interfaces that feel intentional, branded, and human. This skill is **usage agnostic**, stack agnostic, and tool agnostic. Prefer principles over fashion. Do not clone a specific external showcase site.

Operate at a **senior industry craft level**: the bar of a principal product designer and senior frontend craftsperson working together. Ship work that is clear, distinctive, usable, accessible, and ready for real users. Do not settle for average template UI.

**Scope:** Frontend focused, usage open. Follow the user's request. Do not lock the work to mobile, dashboard, admin, marketing, or any other fixed product category. Those labels are only examples. Mode names below are internal routing for composition rules after you read the brief; they are not a menu of allowed app types, and they must not rewrite the user's ask into a different product.

**Design thinking freedom:** Contracts, modes, and professional findings improve judgment. They must not flatten invention. Keep the ability to think the UI differently: invent IA, layout metaphors, hierarchy, interaction patterns, type, color, motion, and visual authorship that fit the brief. Prefer a named distinctive concept over a safe generic template. Do not copy one default admin shell, landing formula, or kit demo when a better structure serves the user.

## Industry craft bar (required)

Hold every design, redesign, and critique to this bar. Fail outputs that miss it.

1. **Goal first:** Name the user goal and primary action before layout or styling.
2. **Structure before paint:** Fix hierarchy, IA, and task flow before color, glow, or decoration.
3. **Distinctive authorship:** Named visual concept plus one signature move. Reject interchangeable AI template looks.
4. **Clarity under real use:** Scan path, labels, density, and next action stay obvious without explanation.
5. **Complete interaction states:** Hover, focus, active, disabled, loading, empty, and error are designed, not omitted.
6. **Accessibility baseline:** Semantic structure, visible focus, readable contrast, keyboard paths, and labeled controls are required, not optional polish.
7. **Responsive by redesign:** Narrow and wide layouts keep the goal; redraw regions when needed instead of crushing a desktop layout.
8. **System honesty:** When a design system or Default File UI is present, maximize registry components first. Create custom chrome only for real discovery gaps, and report those custom creations to the user.
9. **Evidence based judgment:** Critiques cite concrete UI evidence and impact. No vague taste reviews.
10. **Ship ready decisions:** Prefer one strong recommendation and an improve pass over option piles or "looks fine" conclusions.

This bar raises quality. It does not lock usage, and it does not forbid creative or unusual frontend directions that still serve the user.

Project or user hard rules may already cover composition principles. This skill still owns mode routing, the critique workflow, the craft bar, and the output contract. Follow that contract even when principles feel familiar.

Read this file immediately when the skill applies, then follow the task path below. Do not improvise a generic review format.

## UI copy constraints (required)

When implementing or rewriting **user-facing frontend UI** (headlines, subheads, body, labels, buttons, nav, empty states, errors, toasts, placeholders, table headers, tooltips, alt text, and similar visible strings):

- Never use em dashes (`—`) or en dashes (`–`).
- Never use hyphens (`-`) inside ordinary English UI copy. Prefer spaced words, commas, periods, colons, or semicolons.
- Examples of bad UI copy: `Best-in-class`, `Real-time sync`, `Sign-in`, `AI-powered`, `Jan–Mar`, `Design — Build`.
- Examples of good UI copy: `Best in class`, `Realtime sync`, `Sign in`, `AI powered`, `Jan to Mar`, `Design. Build.`

**Allowed exceptions** (not ordinary English marketing compounds):

- Keyboard chords and shortcut labels: `Ctrl K`, `Cmd S`, `Shift Enter`
- Technical identifiers shown as data: model IDs, version tags, API names, file names, code tokens
- Established product or brand names that legally include a hyphen
- Code, class names, file paths, URLs, and CSS identifiers (never subject to this rule)

If unsure whether a string is English UI copy or a technical token, prefer spaced English for labels and buttons; keep the technical form for data cells and monospace IDs.

## When to use

- New frontend UI from a brief or rough idea
- Redesign or visual upgrade of an existing screen
- Critique of hierarchy, brand strength, task clarity, motion, or UX clarity
- Choosing layout, type, color, and interaction patterns for a frontend surface
- Any user facing web UI the user wants built or reviewed (not limited to one product category)

## When not to use

- Pure backend, data modeling, or infra work with no UI surface
- Pixel perfect recreation of one specific external website
- Requests that only need a tiny copy tweak with no design judgment

## Step 0: Classify surface mode (required)

Modes are **routing labels**, not usage locks. Classify from the user's actual brief. Never force a dashboard, mobile app, or marketing page if that is not what they asked for.

Before preflight, classify exactly one primary mode. Emit it as a single line:

`Mode: marketing | workspace | mobileTool` plus one short rationale.

| Mode | Choose when the surface being built is mainly |
|---|---|
| `marketing` | Persuasion or brand first: landing, pitch, portfolio, campaign, promotional product page, and similar |
| `workspace` | Task first tool UI: app shell, admin, analytics, settings, data workbench, and similar (desktop or responsive) |
| `mobileTool` | Thumb first tool UI where the primary deliverable is a mobile web tool shell |

If the brief does not match these examples cleanly, still pick the closest mode for rules only, then build the user's requested frontend. Do not rename their product into "dashboard" or "mobile app" unless that matches the ask.

If the brief mixes modes (for example a marketing page that embeds a product screenshot), classify by the **surface being built**, not the surrounding page type.

**Mixed briefs:** Pick one primary mode for the deliverable. Do not bleed rules across modes.

- Marketing page with an embedded product screenshot → `marketing` (screenshot is media, not an admin shell)
- Logged in app that includes a small promotional banner → `workspace` (banner stays quiet; no hero theater)
- One ask that includes both a landing and an admin → deliver as separate surfaces, each with its own mode line; never use one mode's rules for the other

Misclassification checks:

- "Brand campaign landing" → `marketing`
- "SaaS billing admin" → `workspace`
- "Mobile web triage app" → `mobileTool`

Do not apply marketing hero budget rules to workspace or mobileTool surfaces. Do not apply dashboard chrome to marketing heroes. Do not invent a dashboard or mobile shell when the user asked for something else.

## Step 0b: Classify brief class (required)

After mode, classify how the brief is specified. Emit a second line:

`Brief: spec | problem` plus one short rationale.

| Class | Choose when |
|---|---|
| `spec` | The user listed screens, sections, components, or a near complete UI inventory to implement |
| `problem` | The user described a job, domain, or operator goal and left IA, workflows, and visualizations to the agent |

Rules:

- **spec:** Fidelity to the listed inventory matters. Still apply mode rules, authorship, hierarchy, and critique.
- **problem:** Invent the information architecture, workflows, interaction patterns, and visualizations that fit the user's goal. Fail if the result is a generic template that ignores the stated job.
- If the brief mixes both (a goal plus a short component list), prefer `problem` for IA invention and treat the list as non binding hints.

For `problem` briefs, emit a **decision model** before the section or shell map (four short lines). Adapt the wording to the surface (visitor, customer, or operator):

1. What needs attention
2. Why it happened (or how to see why)
3. What gets worse if ignored
4. What action the user should take next

## Required reference reads

Do not treat references as optional. Open and follow the matching reference file before that work:

| Task | MUST open before proceeding |
|---|---|
| Critique or redesign of existing UI | [references/critique.md](references/critique.md) |
| `marketing` first viewport or hero composition | [references/composition.md](references/composition.md) |
| `workspace` or `mobileTool` shell / density / dashboard | [references/workspace.md](references/workspace.md) |
| Cards, boards, table vs card decisions | [references/cards.md](references/cards.md) |
| Forms, tables, filters, tool navigation | [references/app-patterns.md](references/app-patterns.md) |
| `mobileTool` or narrow tool layout | [references/responsive-app.md](references/responsive-app.md) |
| Adding or redesigning motion | [references/motion.md](references/motion.md) |
| Default File UI present, or task uses kit components/tokens | [references/kit.md](references/kit.md) |

## Preflight (do this before coding)

Answer the checklist for the classified mode. If any item fails, revise the plan before writing UI.

### Marketing preflight

1. **One composition:** Does the first viewport read as one scene, not a dashboard?
2. **Brand first:** Is the brand or product name a hero level signal, not only nav text?
3. **Brand test:** If the nav were removed, could this still belong only to this brand?
4. **Hero budget:** Brand, one headline, one short support line, one CTA group, one dominant visual. Nothing else in the first viewport.
5. **Visual authorship:** Named concept (atmosphere + one signature move). Not a default template look.
6. **Type plan:** Expressive display + readable body. Avoid generic default UI font stacks when brand expression matters.
7. **Motion plan:** 2 to 3 intentional motions max for the first ship.
8. **UX primary action:** What is the single most important next step for the user?

### Workspace / mobileTool preflight

1. **Primary task:** Can you name the job of this view in one short line?
2. **Decision model (problem briefs):** Attention, why, if ignored, action stated?
3. **Shell regions:** Nav, context, primary canvas, optional inspector, overlays defined?
4. **Focal canvas:** Is there one primary focal region with quieter chrome?
5. **Density plan:** Information priority clear; adaptive fill if the canvas would otherwise sit empty?
6. **Visual authorship:** Named concept + one non default signature (type, surface, accent, or data emphasis)?
7. **Data and states:** Filters/search (if any), empty, loading, and error planned?
8. **Collection choice:** Table/rows vs cards justified by task?
9. **Type ladder:** Page title, section title, label, meta, and numeric/data steps distinct?
10. **Nav completeness:** Every nav destination is either a real view or a deliberate empty state with a next action (no dead stubs)?
11. **Mobile region plan:** For `mobileTool` or required narrow widths, are regions redrawn (sheets/sequence), not only shrunk?
12. **Motion as feedback:** 2 to 3 short feedback or region motions named; recipes from [references/motion.md](references/motion.md); no theater before use?
13. **Primary action in chrome:** Is the most important action obvious and reachable?

## Hard rules

### Mode scoped composition

**Marketing**

- One job per section: one purpose, one headline, usually one short supporting sentence.
- Real visual anchor: show the product, place, craft, or context when possible.
- Full bleed hero for promotional surfaces by default. Avoid inset hero cards, side panel heroes, and tiled collages unless the existing system requires them.
- No detached labels, floating badges, promo stickers, or callout chips on top of hero media.
- Reduce clutter: no pill clusters, stat strips, icon rows, or competing text blocks in the hero.
- No dashboard chrome on a marketing or brand page.

**Workspace / mobileTool**

- Task first; brand quiet in chrome.
- One focal canvas; subordinate chrome.
- No marketing hero theater on admin, settings, or triage views.
- Prefer inspector/drawer for triage speed when appropriate.
- Design empty, loading, and error with the happy path.

### Cards and chrome

- Default: no decorative cards.
- Marketing: never use cards in the hero; cards only for interaction or a necessary browsable set.
- Workspace: cards only as interaction containers or justified collections; otherwise tables/rows. Open [references/cards.md](references/cards.md) for table vs card decisions.
- If removing a border, shadow, background, or radius does not hurt understanding or selection, remove it.

### Visual authorship (required)

Name a **visual concept** in 1 to 2 sentences: atmosphere plus one signature move. Encode it in variables and type.

- Reject the default template look unless the brief explicitly asks for it: dark bordered panels + cyan or electric blue accent + flat Inter-like UI type as the whole identity.
- Require at least one non default signature: distinctive type pairing, surface language (material, grid, ink, terminal, editorial), accent strategy, or data emphasis pattern.
- Think structure differently when useful: alternate navigation models, focal regions, denser or quieter canvases, unexpected but clear section order, or a stronger media or data metaphor. Difference must still serve the user goal.
- Marketing: authorship may live in hero, type, and media.
- Workspace / mobileTool: brand stays quiet in chrome; authorship lives in materials, hierarchy, and how data is emphasized, not in campaign heroes.
- Fail outputs that only look like "a professional dark enterprise dashboard" with no named concept.
- Fail safe sameness: a competent but interchangeable UI with no invented point of view when the brief left room to invent.

### Color and look

- Choose a clear direction and encode it as CSS variables (surfaces, text, accent, border, focus, success, warning).
- Avoid defaulting to overused AI looks: purple on white / purple to indigo glow themes; warm cream backgrounds with stock serif + terracotta accents; broadsheet hairline newspaper layouts.
- Workspace extras to avoid: purple gradient sidebars, glass panels everywhere, identical three stat metric cards as fake sophistication, chart junk, icon only unlabeled nav, generic dark SaaS card stacks with a single cyan accent as the only idea.
- Do not rely on dark mode, glow, fully rounded pills, or multi layer shadows as a substitute for hierarchy.
- Keep contrast readable for text and controls. Status color needs text or a legend.

### Typography

- Marketing: purposeful display + calm body; large hero contrast.
- Workspace: calm readable UI type; density friendly; still use a clear ladder (see below).
- Keep line length readable for body copy.

**Workspace type ladder (minimum distinct steps):**

1. Page title
2. Section title
3. Control / column label
4. Body or metadata
5. Numeric or data (monospace allowed)

Fail flat UIs where page title and support line sit at similar size and weight.

### Motion

- Marketing: presence, light scroll continuity, feedback.
- Workspace / mobileTool: feedback, region change, progress. Open [references/motion.md](references/motion.md).
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Do not animate everything. If motion does not clarify structure or feedback, cut it.

### UX (light, mandatory)

- One primary action per view whenever possible; secondary actions quieter.
- Every interactive state needs a clear affordance: hover, focus, active, disabled, loading, empty, error.
- Forms: labels, errors adjacent to fields, submit feedback. Open [references/app-patterns.md](references/app-patterns.md) for forms, tables, and filters.
- Keyboard focus visible. Hit targets comfortable on touch.
- Mobile is part of the design. For tools, open [references/responsive-app.md](references/responsive-app.md).
- Visible UI copy must follow **UI copy constraints** (no hyphens, em dashes, or en dashes in rendered strings).

## Implementation guidance (agnostic)

Use the project's existing design system when one exists. Otherwise:

```css
:root {
  --bg: /* atmosphere base */;
  --surface: /* panels if truly needed */;
  --text: /* primary text */;
  --muted: /* secondary text */;
  --accent: /* decisive action */;
  --border: /* hairline only when needed */;
  --font-display: /* expressive family */;
  --font-body: /* readable family */;
  --space-1: /* tight */;
  --space-2: /* default */;
  --space-3: /* section */;
  --radius: /* product specific, not max pill by default */;
  --ease: /* shared motion curve */;
  --dur: /* short shared duration */;
}
```

- Structure with real landmarks and headings.
- Theme through variables, not scattered literals.
- Keep components boring when the composition is expressive.
- Match existing system conventions when editing inside a codebase.

## Using with Default File UI

When the project uses Default File UI (`@default-file/ui`), or the task needs kit components or tokens:

1. MUST open [references/kit.md](references/kit.md) before inventing UI chrome.
2. Discover before invent: `cover` / `search` / `show` / `tokens` (CLI or MCP), then compose with registry items and kit tokens.
3. **Maximize kit use:** Prefer Default File UI components for every interactive control the registry covers. This is required on single-shot "build everything" prompts, not only when the user names components one by one.
4. **Use the kit color system:** Color and space Default File UI surfaces with kit tokens and kit CSS utilities only.
5. **Custom only on real gaps:** If `cover` / `search` find no suitable item, you may create a custom or local component. Theme it with kit tokens when possible.
6. **Report custom creations:** If you invent any component that is not in the registry, tell the user in the final answer under `## Components not in Default File UI` (name, purpose, that it was not found). Omit the section only when all interactive chrome came from the kit.

If the kit is absent, skip `kit.md` and use the agnostic implementation path above.

## Workflow: design and implement

1. Restate the user goal and primary action.
2. Classify surface mode (Step 0) and emit `Mode: …`.
3. Classify brief class (Step 0b) and emit `Brief: …`.
4. For `problem` briefs, emit the decision model (attention, why, if ignored, action).
5. Run the matching preflight checklist.
6. Define visual authorship: concept paragraph plus one named signature move (not a generic template).
7. Outline map: marketing section map, or workspace shell map (and mobile region plan when needed). For `problem` briefs, invent IA; do not wait for a component list.
8. Open required references for the mode and task.
9. If Default File UI is present, open [references/kit.md](references/kit.md), run discovery, and map needs to registry items before coding. On single-shot builds, cover the full brief and each major region before writing chrome.
10. Implement structure first, then style, then motion (kit components and tokens when the kit is present). Custom controls only where discovery returned a real gap.
11. Verify narrow layout, type ladder, adaptive density, and focus states.
12. Self critique using the matching critique contract below.
13. If any axis is `weak` or `missing`, apply at least one improve pass that fixes the top structural issues before finishing. Do not end on scores alone.
14. If Default File UI is present and any custom components were created, include the `## Components not in Default File UI` report in the final answer.

## Workflow: critique and redesign

1. Classify surface mode (Step 0) and brief class (Step 0b).
2. MUST open [references/critique.md](references/critique.md) before writing findings.
3. Score every axis for that mode `strong`, `weak`, or `missing` using the contract below.
4. For every `weak` or `missing` axis, cite concrete evidence (region, module, or pattern), not a vague adjective.
5. Write findings in a **clear professional** voice (see voice rules below). This shapes how reviews are written; it does not shrink what you can design or build.
6. Propose a redesign plan that fixes the weakest structure or task issues first.
7. Do not start with decorative recoloring if structure scores are weak.
8. For redesign asks: implement the first improve pass, or list exact file-level changes if code is out of scope.

## Critique contract (required)

Use the axis set for the classified mode. Score each axis `strong`, `weak`, or `missing`.

### Professional findings voice (required)

Critique findings, structural issues, quick wins, and improve pass notes must be clear and useful, like a senior frontend product review. Not vague taste commentary, and not a design gallery caption.

This voice applies to **how findings are written**. It does **not** limit usage, and it does **not** reduce design invention. The skill stays usage agnostic and must still invent distinctive UI when the brief allows.

Write each finding as:

1. **Observation** — what is present or missing in the UI (concrete region or pattern)
2. **Impact** — why it matters for this surface (match the mode)
3. **Recommendation** — the structural change to make next

Impact by mode:

- **marketing:** brand clarity, first impression, CTA confidence, trust, section purpose
- **workspace / mobileTool:** task completion, scan path, decision speed, error risk, empty and loading recovery

Voice rules:

- Keep tone calm, specific, and decisive. No hype, no taste only judgments, no trend chasing
- Do not frame success as looking trendy or viral. Frame success as clear hierarchy, strong craft, and a frontend that serves the user's goal
- Recommendations may propose a different IA, layout metaphor, or visual system when that better solves the goal. Do not only suggest minor polish on a generic shell
- Marketing mode still owns brand presence, hero composition, visual authorship, and expressive type or motion
- Workspace and mobileTool findings prioritize task clarity, density, states, and operator error risk, while still requiring distinctive visual authorship when inventing or redesigning
- Never refuse a frontend brief, and never rewrite it into mobile, dashboard, or marketing by default. Route to the closest mode for rules, then build what they asked for
- Never use "professional" as an excuse for bland, template, or copycat UI

### Marketing axes

1. Brand presence
2. Composition
3. Hierarchy
4. Visual anchor
5. Section rhythm
6. CTA clarity
7. Type
8. Color
9. Motion
10. Responsive
11. States
12. Accessibility basics

### Workspace / mobileTool axes

1. Task clarity
2. Shell clarity
3. Hierarchy / density
4. Data scan path
5. Navigation findability
6. Primary action clarity
7. Cards / collections discipline
8. Type
9. Color
10. Visual authorship
11. Motion (feedback)
12. Responsive / mobileTool fitness
13. States + accessibility basics

Emit this structure in the final answer (critique, redesign, or design self critique). Do not substitute a freeform review. Replace the score rows with the axis set for the mode:

```markdown
## Mode
marketing | workspace | mobileTool : <one line rationale>

## Brief
spec | problem : <one line rationale>

## Critique

### Scores
| Axis | Score |
|---|---|
| <mode axis 1> | strong / weak / missing |
| … | … |

### Top 3 structural issues
1. <issue>. Evidence: <region or pattern>. Impact: <mode matched effect on clarity, trust, task, or risk>.
2.
3.

### Top 3 quick wins
1. <change> — <why it improves clarity or the user goal>
2.
3.

### Improve pass
<what you changed, or exact changes to make next>

### Redesign sequence
structure -> type/color -> motion -> states

### Non goals
-
```

For design and implement tasks with any `weak` or `missing` score, the **Improve pass** section is required and must reflect real changes (or explicit file-level edits), not a promise to fix later.

## Output expectations

When designing or redesigning, provide:

1. Mode line and Brief line
2. Decision model (required for `problem` briefs; optional for `spec`)
3. Visual authorship concept (2 to 4 sentences, including the signature move)
4. Section map (marketing) or shell map (workspace / mobileTool)
5. Key UI decisions (type ladder, color, motion, primary action, table vs card, adaptive density when relevant)
6. Implementation (code or concrete component changes)
7. When Default File UI is present and any custom components were created: `## Components not in Default File UI` (see [references/kit.md](references/kit.md))
8. The critique contract above, including professional findings (observation, impact, recommendation), evidence on weak axes, and an improve pass when scores are not all strong

Keep prose short and professional. Prefer decisive recommendations over option piles unless the user asks for alternatives. Stay frontend focused: invent and implement the UI the user wants within the classified mode. Keep thinking original: structure and craft may differ from common templates when that better fits the brief. Meet the industry craft bar on every finish.

## Before finishing

- **Industry craft bar:** Goal first, structure before paint, distinctive authorship, complete states, accessibility baseline, responsive redesign, system honesty, evidence based judgment, ship ready decisions.
- **Mode and Brief:** Classified and stated. Marketing rules not applied to workspace; dashboard chrome not applied to marketing heroes.
- **Problem briefs:** Decision model present; IA invented from the job, not a generic component shopping list.
- **Visual authorship:** Concept and signature move named; default dark cyan SaaS template rejected unless requested.
- **Design invention:** For open briefs, the UI has a distinctive point of view (structure and/or craft). Do not end on a safe generic template.
- **Critique tasks:** Do not send a final answer without scored axes for the correct mode, evidence on each weak/missing axis, professional findings (observation, impact, recommendation), top 3 structural issues, redesign sequence, and non goals.
- **Build scope / usage agnostic:** Deliver the frontend the user asked for. Do not force mobile, dashboard, admin, or marketing templates when that is not the ask.
- **Design or redesign tasks:** Matching preflight answered; section or shell map present; critique contract filled; at least one improve pass applied when any axis is weak or missing.
- **Multi section IA:** No dead nav destinations; stubs must be real empty states with a next action, or the item must be removed from nav.
- **Adaptive density:** Primary canvas does not leave a large empty void without a deliberate fill choice.
- **Kit present:** Discovery from `kit.md` done; interactive chrome maximizes registry components and kit tokens. Custom controls only for real gaps.
- **Kit color system:** New Default File UI surfaces use kit color/spacing tokens and kit CSS only.
- **Kit custom report:** If any non-registry components were created, the final answer includes `## Components not in Default File UI` with name and purpose for each.
- **UI copy:** User-facing English strings follow UI copy constraints; allowed exceptions only as listed above.
- If structure scores are weak, fix hierarchy or task clarity before paint (color, glow, or decorative motion).

## Anti goals

- Average or "good enough" template UI that would not pass a senior design review
- Fashion cloning from external showcase galleries
- Taste only or trend based findings with no clear impact for the surface
- Treating this skill as fixed to mobile, dashboard, admin, or marketing usage
- Rewriting the user's request into a different product category
- Letting professional findings voice suppress invention into bland safe templates
- Skipping accessibility, focus, or interaction states and calling the UI done
- Stack religion (no required framework)
- Generic AI template aesthetics (marketing or workspace flavors)
- Default dark enterprise dashboard with cyan accent and flat type as the whole identity
- Equal weight KPI wallpaper with no triage or decision model
- Sparse tables or canvases floating in unused viewport with no adaptive fill choice
- Overbuilding layout systems for a simple page
- Freeform UI opinions that skip the critique contract
- Hand-rolling chrome when Default File UI already covers the need
- Coloring or spacing Default File UI surfaces with an external utility palette instead of kit tokens
- Single-shot builds that skip kit discovery and invent a full custom control set
- Creating custom components without reporting them to the user
- Using a promotional landing as a template for a logged in admin
- Using a dense admin as a template for a brand campaign hero
- Treating a problem brief as a prompt to copy a generic dashboard template
- Refusing to rethink IA, hierarchy, or visual system when the current one is weak
